Welcome to dplython's documentation!
====================================

Welcome to Dplython: Dplyr for Python.

Dplyr is a library for the language R designed to make data analysis fast and easy. The philosophy of Dplyr is to constrain data manipulation to a few simple functions that correspond to the most common tasks. This maps thinking closer to the process of writing code, helping you move closer to analyze data at the "speed of thought".

The goal of this project is to implement the functionality of the R package Dplyr on top of Python's pandas.

* `dplyr <https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html>`_
* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html>`_

This is version 0.0.4. It's experimental and subject to change.
